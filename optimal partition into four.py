"""
Given an array of n non-negative integers. Choose three indices i.e. (0 <= index_1 <= index_ 2<= index_3 <= n) from the array 

to make four subsets such that the term sum(0, index_1) â€“ sum(index_1, index_2) + sum(index_2, index_3) â€“ sum(index_3, n) is maximum possible.

Here, two indices say l and r means, the sum(l, r) will be the sum of all numbers of subset on positions from l to r non-inclusive 

(l-th element is not counted, r-th element is counted). 

For example, if arr = {-5, 3, 9, 4}, then sum(0, 1) = -5, sum(0, 2) = -2, sum(1, 4) = 16 and sum(i, i) = 0 for each i from 0 to 4.

For indices l and r holds 0 <= l <= r <= n. Indices in array are numbered from 0.

Input:
First line contains integer n
Second line contains elements of array

Output:
Print the indices that follows given condition

Examples:

Input :
3
-1 2 3
Output :
0 1 3

Explanation:
Here, sum(0, 0) = 0
      sum(0, 1) = -1
      sum(1, 3) = 2 + 3 = 5
      sum(3, 3) = 0
Therefore , sum(0, 0) - sum(0, 1) + sum(1, 3) - sum(3, 3) = 4
which is maximum.

Input :
4
0 0 -1 0

Output :
0 0 0
Here, sum(0, 0) - sum(0, 0) + sum(0, 0) - sum(0, 0) = 0
which is maximum possible.
